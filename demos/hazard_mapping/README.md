## Integrating ML-Hazard Mapping into the AI-platform

This project sets up a workflow for investigating mountain slopes for their likelihood of the occurrence of shallow landslide-type slope failures using an decision tree-based ML model. The work has mainly been conducted locally without the Juwels resources. Through the AI-platform it is possible to manage the training workflows and also to track the experiments and their results.
